Long Description: 86 volts. That's all this little powerhouse needs to spring to life. 86 volts of pure energy to perk her up and wake the dead. Who is 86 Volts? Where does she come from? What does she want? These questions lead to shocking answers, but don't tell 86, because she knows even less than you do. She awakes in a world of dreams from some previous unknown adventure that left her lifeless upon a gravestone awaiting a bolt of lightning to bring her back to life. What will happen when little 86 throws down and mixes it up against a witch and her evil fetus? When black science and white magic clash in a spiritual free-for-all, the only result is pure chaos. Teaming up once again following their novel QUIXOTE, writer BRYAN J.L. GLASS and artist MICHAEL AVON OEMING have concocted one super-charged little fairy tale that leaves no one standing following its no-holds-barred, knock-down, drag-out brawl of the living dead. This 56-page one-shot is chock full of action, poetry, darkness and redemption. What more could you ask for? Make sure your batteries are fully charged (and your dead are properly buried) before reading this issue of utter mayhem and fun.

He can't actually use the sword he carries around and he only wears a ninja mask, which he never takes off. He seems quite strange, but he's just a man who coped with having everything he loved in life taken away from him, by convincing himself he was meant to fight crime as a ninja detective. Yes he's lonely, and yes he's only hiding from the pain of his former life. But he's busy working whatever cases he can get using his true calling and talent in life, computers.

No one in the Valiant Universe is more terrifying, more dangerous or more experienced in the art of war than the undying Eternal Warrior. After thousands of years on the battlefield, he's a master of strategy and weaponry, an unrelenting force of nature capable of dismantling entire armies with little effort and less conscience. His brother Armstrong, on the other hand, likes to read poetry and drink beer. Maybe that's why they had such a bad falling out? But now--after years apart--the Eternal Warrior has a new mission: destroy young Obadiah Archer, Armstrong's best-est new buddy and teammate in the war against The Sect. And, like it or not, Valiant's history-smashing adventure duo will soon feel the wrath of the Eternal Warrior's fist and steel.

Long Description: 260 pages! Beyond Palomar collects two of Gilbert's groundbreaking works about the Central American hamlet of Palomar in one affordable book."Poison River" is a dizzying period piece often hailed as one of Hernandez's masterpieces. It traces the pre-Palomar childhood of Luba, her teenage marriage to gangster Peter Rio, the secrets behind her mysterious mother, all the way up to her subsequent escape and arrival in Palomar. "Love and Rockets X," set in the early 1990s (in the waning years of Bush I's post-Reagan hangover, with Gulf War I in the background), takes us from plush Beverly Hills to the dangerous east side and introduces us to a dizzyingly diverse cast of characters, including a lowlife rock 'n' roll band, a "posse" of black youths, a ditzy Hollywood mom and her spoiled son, a gay activist filmmaker and his rebellious, half-Iraqi daughter, and a group of racist thugs whose violent attack on an older woman sets the plot in motion.

BONUS!

On the distant world of Illal, corporate rivalry turns to warfare as secret technologies are discovered, coveted, and stolen. Mega-planetary corporate empires, SENTIUM and PROSK, each seek to out-jockey each other in the race for technical superiority in the marketplace, but when the value of that superiority eclipses the cost of human life, no degree of diplomacy can bridge the gap. Now, with the discovery of a revolutionary new geological element, both sides fight tooth and nail for the materials that will keep them one step ahead of the other in an escalating arms race that will ? unbeknownst to all ? lead to the ruin of the planet? In this second of four preview releases, exclusive to comiXology, writer Jeremy Barlow (Mass Effect, Star Wars) and artist Bagus Hutomo (Shrapnel, Heavy Metal) bring you "CAT AND MOUSE", lettered by Deron Bennet (Tale of Sand, The Dark Crystal).

Long Description: Shianndrea Toshigawa is "The Chosen One" of the Toshigawa Ninja Clan. She is the only warrior powerful enough to save the world from the wrath of the Knave, a demonic samurai army led by her father, Terminus. Although Shianndrea longs for a normal life away from the weight of her destiny, she is hunted at every turn. Taki Sato, one of the most deadly warriors in all of Japan wants Shianndrea dead and the monstrous tracker known as Desai would like nothing more than to restore his honor by breaking Shianndrea and returning her to Terminus. Now this reluctant warrior must cope with the fear of her destiny, a battle to the death and a rumor that another clan member is traitor. Created by Martheus Wade and optioned for a motion picture, "Beginnings" will be the first in a series of Jetta: Tales of the Toshigawa digital omnibus collections to be released over the next two years. "Beginnings" collects Jetta ? Last Chances (first published in 2003) and Jetta ? Crucible (first published in 2009) into one 120 page full color graphic novel. With all new story additions, art and ending commentary, Beginnings brings an entirely new reading experience to these exciting books and provides an excellent jumping on point for new readers who have always wanted to check out one of the most popular female characters in independent comics.

Long Description: Sometimes science fiction is all in your head... and sometimes it's all in your face. Agent Six has been sent here to retrieve defectors from Command, but everything is not as it seems... because Six wasn't sent from another country, he was sent from another plane of existence. And not only have the defectors gone rogue, they've gone crazy. They've turned their backs on their sterile, logical world to live in the grim and gritty emotional world of earth--but can they handle it? What happens when an alien mind is exposed to the logic and emotion of "humanity" through dreams? Agent Six is about to find out as he takes a trip through the human psyche in an effort to recover rogue agents sent to Earth to study us. As Six's mission continues and he struggles with his newfound freedom, the greater his chances are to become infected... by humanity. Extras include a sketchbook section by OEMING and pin-ups by MATT WAGNER, DAVID MACK, ANDY LEE, KLAUS JANSON and others!

And through all of this perilous disorder, Grace attempts to overcome the greatest obstacle she has yet to encounter in her time in Empyrea-the bonds of love. Collecting together the entire sold out SOULFIRE: SHADOW MAGIC mini-series, and fully illustrated by Sana Takeda, this long-awaited trade paperback is a must have addition to your Soulfire collection!
